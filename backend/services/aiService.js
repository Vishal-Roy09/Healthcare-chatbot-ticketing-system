/**
 * Enhanced AI Service for TicketHub Healthcare Chatbot
 * ====================================================
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This service powers the AI chatbot that automatically responds to patient inquiries.
 * It analyzes messages to understand what patients are asking about and provides helpful responses.
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - Understands patient questions (intent classification)
 * - Identifies important medical information in messages (entity recognition)
 * - Detects if patients are upset or urgent cases (sentiment analysis)
 * - Remembers previous conversations (conversation context)
 * - Supports multiple languages (language support)
 * - Improves over time based on feedback (learning system)
 * 
 * HOW TO USE THIS SERVICE:
 * 1. Import the generateAIResponse function
 * 2. Call it with the patient's message
 * 3. Get back an appropriate response
 * 
 * Example: const response = await generateAIResponse(message, category, userId, language);
